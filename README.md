# Powers of Two for Clover

![Powers Of Two App](https://github.com/avastjohn/powers-of-two/raw/master/src/powers-of-two.png | width=200)

### What the app does
This app provides a form for the user to enter sequential powers of two, then validate the input and provide visual error feedback. Blank inputs are always considered valid, as it is assumed the user has not entered information there yet. When multiple valid sequences appear, display the smallest possible number of errors.

### Example
4, 8, 32, 64, 128 would display errors on the first two elements because the last three are a longer valid sequence.
